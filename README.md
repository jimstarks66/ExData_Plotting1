## Introduction

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on
the course web site:


* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available.

## The Assignment
The assignment was to recreate 4 exploratory graphs based on the dataset filtered to include only the dates of 2/1/2007 and 2/2/2007.

The 4 graphs are included in this repository as png files as listed below:
* plot1.png
* plot2.png
* plot3.png
* plot4.png

The R scripts necessary to create these plots are included in this repository as png files as listed below:
* plot1.R
* plot2.R
* plot3.R
* plot4.R

All R scripts use the assigned local directory as the workspace for the data. Workspace should be reassigned to the appropriate location prior to attempting to recreate these files.
